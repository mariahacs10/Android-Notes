So step 1. You need to create a jasva class called MyWorker and write:


public class MyWorker extends Worker {
    public static final String TAG ="MyWorker";
    public static int number1 = 23;
    public static int number2 = 26;


    public MyWorker(@NonNull Context context, @NonNull WorkerParameters workerParams) {
        super(context, workerParams);
    }


    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Result doWork() {

**       //to call an activity from a non activity class, you have to use getApplicationContext() like the code below
        
  ***THIS is important because if you dont want the notifcation to pop up
      ALL THE TIME you need to call getApplicationContext(), For example
      if you set a Network constraint the notifcatin will pop up 
      even if you turn off the internet, BUT When you do this code below it wont
       pop up if you dont have wifi***


         NotificationCompat.Builder builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(getApplicationContext(), "My Notification");
          builder.setContentTitle("Successful " + number1 + " + " + number2 + " = " + String.valueOf(number1 + number2) );
          builder.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher_background);

          builder.setAutoCancel(true);

         //this lets android know what activity you want it to be called in
         NotificationManagerCompat managerCompat = NotificationManagerCompat.from(getApplicationContext());
         managerCompat.notify(1, builder.build());

        return Result.success(); ****
    }
}

Step 2. Open up the MainActivity.java file and write this code:
 @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        
        //This is to check if your version code is oreo
        if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
        {
            NotificationChannel channel = new NotificationChannel("My Notification","My Notification",NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT);
            NotificationManager manager = getSystemService(NotificationManager.class);
            manager.createNotificationChannel(channel);
        }
         
        //This is your Constraint that will ONLY run if you have wifi
        Constraints constraints = new Constraints.Builder()
                .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)
                .build();

         //This is your OneTimeWorkRequest that is only going to do the
        //work ONCE
        OneTimeWorkRequest oneTimeWorkRequest = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(MyWorker.class)
                //This is to set the constraint if you dont have it
                //The constraint wont work
                .setConstraints(constraints)
                .build();

        WorkManager.getInstance().enqueue(oneTimeWorkRequest);

Run it and it'll work ðŸ™ƒ
