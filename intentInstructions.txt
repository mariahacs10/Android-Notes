Intent, Whenever you want an activity to start a second activity, you use an intent.

You can think of an intent as an “intent to do something.” It’s a type of
message that allows you to bind separate objects (such as activities) together
at runtime. If one activity wants to start a second activity, it does it by
sending an intent to Android. Android will then start the second activity
and pass it the intent.


******Create an intent that specifies an action:
	(This activates an activity inside your app)
 Intent intent = new Intent(this, ReceiveMessageActivity.class);
 
This intent is an example of an explicit intent; 
 you explicitly tell Android which class you want it to run.**

Implicit intent:
   An action you want done but you don’t care which
   activity does it, you  create an implicit intent.

How to create an intent to access a outside application:

 Intent.ACTION_DIAL to dial a number,
 Intent.ACTION_WEB_SEARCH to perform a web search
 Intent.ACTION_SEND to send a message. 
 Create an intent that specifies you want to send a message:
 Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);*****

****Adds an action to an intent filter. 
An <intent-filter> element must contain one or 
more <action> elements.*****
