Intent, Whenever you want an activity to start a second activity, you use an intent.

You can think of an intent as an “intent to do something.” It’s a type of
message that allows you to bind separate objects (such as activities) together
at runtime. If one activity wants to start a second activity, it does it by
sending an intent to Android. Android will then start the second activity
and pass it the intent.
