	 * Activity: 
	 * 
     *   An activity, typically represents a single user interface screen within an app.
     *   One option is to construct the activity using a single user interface layout and one 
     *   corresponding activity class file.
	 *
	 * Fragment:
	 * 
	 * 	A better alternative, however, is to break the activity into different sections.
	 *  Each of these sections is referred to as a fragment, each of which consists of part of
	 *  the user interface layout and a matching class file 
	 *  (declared as a subclass of the Android Fragment class). 
	 *  In this scenario, an activity simply becomes a container into which one
	 *	or more fragments are embedded.
	 *
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Intents
	 *  
	 *   Intents are the mechanism by which one activity is able to launch another and implement
	 *   the flow through the activities that make up an application. 
	 *   Intents consist of a description of the operation to be performed and,
     *   optionally, the data on which it is to be performed.
	 *
	 * Broadcast Intents:
	 *   
	 *    The Android system, for example, will typically send out Broadcast
	 *	  Intents to indicate changes in device status such as the completion of system start up,
	 *    connection of an external power source to the device or the screen being turned on or off.
