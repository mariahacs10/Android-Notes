Step 1. Go to the build.app gradle file and add your depend:

implementation "android.arch.work:work-runtime:1.0.0-alpha11"


Step 2. create a java class called MyWorker, Inside MyWorker add:
 //This is a default TAG
 public static final String TAG ="MyWorker";

    public MyWorker(@NonNull Context context, @NonNull WorkerParameters workerParams) {
        super(context, workerParams);
    }

	
    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Result doWork() {
        
        //Are work is to add two numbers 1 and 2
        int number1 = 23;
        int number2 = 26;
        
        //Now log the output aka the print out
        Log.e(TAG, "doWorks addition of two numbers " + String.valueOf(number1 + number2));
        
        //Are result is success because are app is running
        //successfuly
        return Result.success();
    }

Step 3. Go Under the MainActivity and write:

       //This is your constraints it can be anything
        Constraints constraints = new Constraints.Builder()
                .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)
                .build();

        //This is your one time work request
        OneTimeWorkRequest oneTimeWorkRequest = new OneTimeWorkRequest.Builder(MyWorker.class)
               //MAKE SURE YOU SET YOUR CONSTRAINTS
                .setConstraints(constraints)
                .build();
       
       //This is how you want to enqueue your app
        WorkManager.getInstance().enqueue(oneTimeWorkRequest);
