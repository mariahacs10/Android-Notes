When you use an implicit intent, Android uses the information in the
intent to figure out which components are able to receive it. It does this
by checking the intent filters in every app’s copy of AndroidManifest.xml.


intent filter:

specifies what types of intent each component can
receive. As an example, here’s the entry for an activity that can handle
an action of ACTION_SEND. The activity is able to accept data with
MIME types of text/plain or image:

<intent-filter>

(Even though the book says android.intent.category.DEFAULT
 in 2021 it is using android.intent.category.LAUNCHER)

<action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND"/>
<category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
<data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
<data android:mimeType="image/*"/>

</intent-filter>

*******IMPORTANT!*******

The intent filter also specifies a category. 
An intent filter must include a category of:

****android.intent.category. LAUNCHER****

if it’s to receive implicit intents. If an activity has no intent filter,
or it doesn’t include a category name of:

android.intent. category.LAUNCHER

it means that the activity can’t be started with an implicit intent.
It can only be started with an explicit intent using the full name
(including the package) of the component.
