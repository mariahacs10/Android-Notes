11.8 Migrating a Project to View Binding
-----------------------------------------------------

The process for converting a project module 
to use view binding involves the following steps:

1.  Edit the module level Gradle build script file listed in the Project tool window as Gradle Scripts -> build.
gradle (Module: <project name>.app) where <project name> is the name of the project (for example
AndroidSample).

2.  Locate the android section of the file and add an entry to enable the viewBinding property as follows:
android {
.
.
buildFeatures {
viewBinding true
}

3.  Click on the Sync Now link at the top of the editor to resynchronize the project with these new build settings.
4.  Edit the MainActivity.kt file and modify it to read as follows (where <reverse domain> represents the domain
name used when the project was created and <project name> is replaced by the lowercase name of the
project, for example androidsample) and <binding name> is the name of the binding for the corresponding
layout resource file (for example the binding for activity_main.xml is ActivityMainBinding).
.
.
    import android.view.View;
    import com.<reverse domain>.<project name>.databinding.<binding name>;

    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    private <binding name> binding;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    binding = <binding name>.inflate(getLayoutInflater());

    View view = binding.getRoot();

     setContentView(view);
}
5.  Access views by name as properties of the binding object.
