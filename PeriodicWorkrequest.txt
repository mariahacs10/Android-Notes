Step 1. Go to the build.grade app 

This is the right dependency as of  1/12/2022 . For example:

    def work_version = "2.7.1"
    implementation "androidx.work:work-runtime:$work_version"

*Link to google dev:  https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/work*


Other versions that work are: 1.0.0 
implementation "android.arch.work:work-runtime:1.0.0-alpha11"
This is were i got it from (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKOKZ0RRgBE)


Step 2. Create a new Java class called MyPeriodicWork
And make sure you've extended Worker:


public class MyPeriodicWork extends Worker {

    //This is a default tag
    private static final String TAG = "MyPeriodicWork";

    public MyPeriodicWork(@NonNull Context context, @NonNull WorkerParameters workerParams) {
        super(context, workerParams);
    }
	
   //This is the doWork method
    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Result doWork() {
	
        //You can do any Task here
        Log.e(TAG, "doWork: work is done :).");
        //We return success because our task Was successful
        return Result.success();
    }
}

Step 3.Go into the MainActivity  and write:

//Make a TAG
public static final String TAG = "MainActivity";

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        
        //This is a constraint you can add whatever you want
       //to it
        Constraints constraints = new Constraints.Builder()
                .setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true)
                .build();
        
        //Now you got to make sure workRequest 
        PeriodicWorkRequest periodicWorkRequest = new PeriodicWorkRequest.Builder(
                MyPeriodicWork.class, 20, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
                //MAKE SURE YOU SET THE CONSTRAINTS!
                .setConstraints(constraints)
                .build();

       //To enqueue this work you need to getIntstance of
        //the work manager
        WorkManager.getInstance().enqueue(periodicWorkRequest);

    }

Step 4: RUN your app peace âœŒ
