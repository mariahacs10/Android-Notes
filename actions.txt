Actions:
 A way of telling Android what standard operations activities
 can perfom. As an example, Android knows that all activities
 registered for a send action are capable of sending messages.

Create an intent that specifies an action:
 Intent intent = new Intent(this, ReceiveMessageActivity.class);
 
 **This intent is an example of an explicit intent; 
 you explicitly tell Android which class you want it to run.**

Implicit intent:
   An action you want done but you donâ€™t care which
   activity does it, you  create an implicit intent.
