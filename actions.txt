Actions:
 A way of telling Android what standard operations activities
 can perfom. As an example, Android knows that all activities
 registered for a send action are capable of sending messages.

Create an intent that specifies an action:
	(This activates an activity inside your app)
 Intent intent = new Intent(this, ReceiveMessageActivity.class);
 
 **This intent is an example of an explicit intent; 
 you explicitly tell Android which class you want it to run.**

Implicit intent:
   An action you want done but you donâ€™t care which
   activity does it, you  create an implicit intent.

How to create an intent to access a outside application:

 Intent.ACTION_DIAL to dial a number,
 Intent.ACTION_WEB_SEARCH to perform a web search
 Intent.ACTION_SEND to send a message. 
 Create an intent that specifies you want to send a message:
 Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
