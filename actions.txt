Actions:
 A way of telling Android what standard operations activities
 can perfom. As an example, Android knows that all activities
 registered for a send action are capable of sending messages.

Create an intent that specifies an action:
	(This activates an activity inside your app)
 Intent intent = new Intent(this, ReceiveMessageActivity.class);
 
 **This intent is an example of an explicit intent; 
 you explicitly tell Android which class you want it to run.**

Implicit intent:
   An action you want done but you don’t care which
   activity does it, you  create an implicit intent.

How to create an intent to access a outside application:

 Intent.ACTION_DIAL to dial a number,
 Intent.ACTION_WEB_SEARCH to perform a web search
 Intent.ACTION_SEND to send a message. 
 Create an intent that specifies you want to send a message:
 Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);

**Adding extra information**:
 
  Once you’ve specified the action you want to use, 
  you can add extra information to it. We want to pass some text
  with the intent that will form the body of the message we’re 
  sending. To do this, you use the following lines of code:
  
  intent.setType("text/plain"); 
  intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, messageText);

 You want the activity to be able to handle data with a 
 MIME data-type of text/plain, and also tells it what the text is.

**putExtra()** method:
   
   You can make extra calls to the putExtra() method if there’s 
   additional information you want to add. 
   As an example, if you want to specify the subject
   of the message, you can use:

       intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT, subject);
   
    where subject is the subject of the message.
